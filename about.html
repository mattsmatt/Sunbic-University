        <h2 class="article__head">OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <br />
        <section class="article--about">
          <img src="./assets/about-3.jpg" alt="" />
          <div>
            <p>
              Originally founded in 1993 as Sunny Bicker University, a public
              university, we’ve stayed true to our beliefs since the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the years, we’ve worked hard to empower students of all
              backgrounds with choice and guidance—so that they can find their
              best fit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, we gradually shift our model from onsite classes to
              online. When Sunny Bicker became Sunbic, we continued this
              mission, expanding our catalogue even further.
            </p>
            <p>
              To this day, we continue to work hard to bring new and exciting
              courses, and universities, into our catalogue so that students can
              achieve their goals.
